When using composer to install a package, an error message `cURL error 60: SSL certificate: unable to get local issuer certificate`. As we will see later in this post, this is due to a certificate issue.

Recently, when trying to install a package through composer on MacOS, I came across a code 60 curl error. This error was related to a problem with the certificate. Even running the diagnose or selfupdate command to update it, the message below appeared:

```bash
Composer\Downloader\TransportException
curl error 60 while downloading https://getcomposer.org/versions: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
```

I tested the curl command to make any call, such as https://google.com. The error message that appeared told me that the certificate file used by curl was expired:

```bash
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: certificate has expired
More details here: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html
```

After searching forums across the web for the solution, I found myself with different workarounds to get around the error. One is to use the -k parameter, or â€“insecure. However, this would only be palliative, because with this command we are explicitly allowing curl to make insecure SSL connections, which is not recommended.

The solution found and that most directly solved this certificate problem was to do the following step by step:

- locate the cert.pem file in /etc/ssl/
- rename it with the command mv cert.pem old_cert.pem
- download the updated file at https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html
- save it in the /etc/ssl folder with the name cert.pem

After this procedure, the composer command ran normally, installing the desired package.

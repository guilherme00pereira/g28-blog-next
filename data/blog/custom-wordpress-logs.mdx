When creating a plugin for WordPress, we often need to record events, actions and captured errors to analyze the functioning of our plugin and thus correct any failures. In this example,
I'm going to create a class that will record log files separated by date and show how we can record a log and display the result on the screen.

The first step will be to create the class that will represent the object that will register the logs. This class will follow the Singleton design pattern, containing the getInstance()
method to have access to a single instance of the Logger object throughout the plugin.

```php

<?php
namespace G28\MyPlugin;
class Logger
{
    protected static $_instance = null;
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->filename   = "log_" . date("Ymd") . ".txt";
        $this->filepath   = Plugin::getDir() . 'logs/' . $this->actualFilename;
    }
    public static function getInstance(): ?Logger {
        if ( is_null( self::$_instance ) ) {
            self::$_instance = new self();
        }
        return self::$_instance;
    }
}

```

In the code above I have included 2 properties in this class: filename and filepath. In filename we will add a filename representing the day date.
Thus, whenever we call the object of the class to save a record, it will be saved in the file that will identify the date on which it occurred.

I'll also add the add() method, adding the message we want to write to the end of the file:

```php

public function add( string $origin, string $message ) {
        date_default_timezone_set('America/Sao_Paulo');
        $timestamp    = date('d/m/Y h:i:s A');
        $output = "[ $timestamp ] $origin - $message" . PHP_EOL;
        file_put_contents( $this->filepath, $output, FILE_APPEND);
    }

```

In the first line, I define the timezone to which I want the registration time to be compatible with my location, in this case Brazil.
In the second line I am formatting the date and time and, in the third line, I create the string that will be recorded in the file, with the time,
the origin indicating which class/method called the Logger object for registration and the message received by the method, in addition to from a line break to the end.
In the last line I call the file_put_contents method to write the data to the file.

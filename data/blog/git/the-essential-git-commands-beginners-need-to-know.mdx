Git is such a powerful tool for collaboration and version control. It helps you move fast and save time by managing multiple versions of your website's code as it develops. But what does all this mean? What are "commits" and "branches"? In this post, I'll explain the most essential Git commands every beginner needs to know.

## Starting and pushing a new git repository

#### git init

Git init is used to initialize and create a new Git repository in the current directory. 

#### git add

Git add adds the changes of a specific file or folder to your local staging area, which means they'll be included in the next commit you make. This command is used to add files from your hard drive into the repository. You can also use it to add directories, but it's important that they don't contain any other git repositories inside them. If you want to include submodules with a git checkout command, then make sure that they are checked out first before running this command. 

#### git status

The git status command is used to see what files have changed, which files are staged and unstaged, etc. If you run this command without any options, Git will show you all files that are not tracked by Git.

#### git commit

#### git remote

#### git push


## Working with Branches

// delete branch locally
```bash
git branch -d localBranchName
```

// delete branch remotely

```bash
git push origin --delete remoteBranchName
```

## Discard Changes

```bash
git restore <filename>
```

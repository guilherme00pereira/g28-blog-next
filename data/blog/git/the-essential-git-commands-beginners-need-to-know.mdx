Git is such a powerful tool for collaboration and version control. It helps you move fast and save time by managing multiple versions of your website's code as it develops. But what does all this mean? What are "commits" and "branches"? In this post, I'll explain the most essential Git commands every beginner needs to know.

## Starting and pushing a new git repository

#### git init

Git init is used to initialize and create a new Git repository in the current directory. This command is used to create a new repository in the current directory. It will create a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files â€” a Git repository skeleton. This is the most basic command in Git, and it is used to initialize a new repository.

```bash
git status
```

#### git add

This command is used to add files from your hard drive into the repository. You can also use it to add directories, but it's important that they don't contain any other git repositories inside them. If you want to include submodules with a git checkout command, then make sure that they are checked out first before running this command.

To add a specific file, you can use the following command:

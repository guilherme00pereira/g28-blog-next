Git is such a powerful tool for collaboration and version control. It helps you move fast and save time by managing multiple versions of your website's code as it develops. But what does all this mean? What are "commits" and "branches"? In this post, I'll explain the most essential Git commands every beginner needs to know.

## Starting and Pushing a New Git Repository

### git init

Git init is used to initialize and create a new Git repository in the current directory. It will create a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files â€” a Git repository skeleton. This is the most basic command in Git, and it is used to initialize a new repository.

### git status

The git status command is used to see what files have changed, which files are staged and which files are not staged. It's a good idea to run this command before you commit your changes to make sure you're committing the right files.

```bash
git status
```

### git add

Git add adds the changes of a specific file or folder to your local staging area, which means they'll be included in the next commit you make. This command is used to add files from your hard drive into the repository. You can also use it to add directories, but it's important that they don't contain any other git repositories inside them. If you want to include submodules with a git checkout command, then make sure that they are checked out first before running this command.

To add a specific file, you can use the following command:

```bash
git add <filename>
```

To include all files in the current directory, you can use the following command:

```bash
git add .
```

### git commit

Git commit is used to save the changes you've made to your local repository. It's important to note that this command only saves the changes to your local repository, not to the remote repository. To save the changes to the remote repository, you'll need to use the git push command.

```bash
git commit -m "commit message"
```

### git push

Git push is used to push your local commits to the remote repository. It's important to note that this command only pushes the commits to the remote repository, not to the local repository. To push the commits to the local repository, you'll need to use the git commit command.

```bash
git push origin master
```

The master branch is the default branch in Git. It's the branch that you'll be working on most of the time. If you want to push your changes to a different branch, you can use the following command:

```bash
git push origin <branchname>
```

## Working with Remotes and Cloning Repositories

### git remote

Git remote is used to manage your remote repositories. It's important to note that this command only manages the remote repositories, not the local repositories. To manage the local repositories, you'll need to use the git clone command.

```bash

// add remote
git remote add origin <remote url>

// remove remote
git remote remove origin
```

### git clone

Git clone is used to clone a remote repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <remote url>
```

## Working with Commits

### git log

Git log is used to view the commit history of a repository. It's important to note that this command only shows the commit history, not the changes that were made in each commit. To see the changes that were made in each commit, you'll need to use the git diff command.

```bash
git log
```

### git diff

Git diff is used to view the changes that were made in a commit.

```bash
git diff
```

### git reset

Git reset is used to undo a commit. It's important to note that this command only undoes the commit, not the changes that were made in the commit. To undo the changes that were made in the commit, you'll need to use the git checkout command.

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### git checkout

Git checkout is used to undo the changes that were made in a commit.

```bash
git checkout <filename>
```

## Working with Branches

### git branch

Git branch is used to create, list, rename, and delete branches.

```bash
// create branch
git branch <branchname>

// list branches
git branch

// rename branch
git branch -m <oldbranchname> <newbranchname>

// delete branch
git branch -d <branchname>

// delete branch remotely
git push origin --delete <branchname>

```

### git checkout branch

Git checkout is used to switch between branches.

```bash
git checkout <branchname>
```

### git merge

Git merge is used to merge branches, i.e. if you are working on a branch and want to merge the changes into the master branch, use this command.

```bash
git merge <branchname>
```

### git rebase

Git rebase is used to rebase branches. Git rebase is a way to integrate changes from one branch into another. It's a bit like a merge, but it's different in two important ways:

```bash
git rebase <branchname>
```

## Working with Stashes

### git stash

Git stash is used to stash changes, i.e. if you are working on a branch and want to switch to another branch, use this command to stash the changes.

```bash
git stash
```

### git stash pop

Git stash pop is used to pop stashes.

```bash
git stash pop
```

## Working with Staging

### git add

Git add is used to add files to the staging area.

```bash
git add <filename>
```

### git commit

Git commit is used to commit files that where staged.

```bash

// commit all files
git commit -a -m "commit message"

// commit specific files
git commit <filename> -m "commit message"

```

### git restore

Git restore is used to restore files from the staging area.

```bash
git restore <filename>
```

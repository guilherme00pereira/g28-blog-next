## Introduction

CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are a popular data format used for storing and exchanging tabular data. In Python, the Pandas library is commonly used for reading and manipulating data from CSV files.

To better visualize the data, you can install the Pandas library and use the Jupyter Notebook to run the code examples in this article.

```bash

pip install pandas jupyterLab

```

## Reading a CSV File

The Pandas library provides the read_csv() function for reading CSV files. The function returns a Pandas DataFrame object, which is a two-dimensional data structure that can be used to store tabular data.

The following example shows how to read a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame object.

```python

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
print(df)

```

The read_csv() function accepts a number of optional parameters that can be used to customize the way the CSV file is read. For example, the following example shows how to read a CSV file that uses a semicolon as a delimiter.

```python

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv', sep=';')

```

To get the column names of a DataFrame object, use the columns property.

```python

print(df.columns)

```

To get the number of rows and columns of a DataFrame object, use the shape property.

```python

print(df.shape)

```

To query a DataFrame object, use the loc property. The following example shows how to query the DataFrame object to get the value of the first row and first column.

```python

print(df.loc[0,0])

```

You can also use the `query()` function to query a DataFrame object. The following example shows how to query the DataFrame object to get the value of the first row and first column.

```python

print(df.query('index == 0 and column == 0'))

```

To get the first n rows of a DataFrame object, use the head() function. The following example shows how to get the first 5 rows of the DataFrame object.

```python

print(df.head())

```

To get the last n rows of a DataFrame object, use the tail() function. The following example shows how to get the last 5 rows of the DataFrame object.

```python

print(df.tail())

```

To get the data types of the columns of a DataFrame object, use the dtypes property.

```python

print(df.dtypes)

```

To get the number of non-null values in each column of a DataFrame object, use the count() function.

```python

print(df.count())

```

To get the number of unique values in each column of a DataFrame object, use the nunique() function.

```python

print(df.nunique())

```

To get the number of missing values in each column of a DataFrame object, use the isnull() function.

```python

print(df.isnull().sum())

```

To select some of the columns of a DataFrame object, use the following syntax.

```python

df = df[['column1', 'column2']]

```

## Writing a CSV File

After filtering and manipulating the data, you can write the returned data to a CSV file.

The Pandas library provides the to_csv() function for writing a DataFrame object to a CSV file. The following example shows how to write a DataFrame object to a CSV file.

```python

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

df.to_csv('data.csv')

```

The to_csv() function accepts a number of optional parameters that can be used to customize the way the CSV file is written. For example, the following example shows how to write a DataFrame object to a CSV file that uses a semicolon as a delimiter.

```python

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

df.to_csv('data.csv', sep=';')

```

## Conclusion

In summary, reading and writing CSV files with Python and Pandas is a simple and effective way to work with tabular data. With its powerful data manipulation capabilities and ease of use, Pandas is a popular library for data analysis and data science tasks.

## Run Python Scripts from Command Line

This article will show you how to run Python scripts from the command line. This is useful if you want to run a Python script from a cron job or from a shell script. You can also use this to run Python scripts from a Makefile.

To run a Python script from the command line, you need to use the `python` command. The `python` command takes the name of the Python script as an argument.

To exemplify, let's create a simple Python script called `hello.py`:

```python

print("Hello, World!")

```

To run the `hello.py` script, you would run the following command:

```bash

python hello.py

```

The output of the `hello.py` script would be:

```bash

Hello, World!

```

## Run Python Scripts from Command Line with Arguments

You can also pass arguments to Python scripts from the command line. To do this, you need to use the `-a` or `--arg` flags.

To exemplify, let's create a simple Python script called `add.py`:

```python

import sys

print(int(sys.argv[1]) + int(sys.argv[2]))

```

To run the `add.py` script, you would run the following command:

```bash

python add.py -a 1 -a 2

```

The output of the `add.py` script would be:

```bash

3

```

## Run Python Scripts from Command Line with Flags

You can also pass flags to Python scripts from the command line. To do this, you need to use the `-f` or `--flag` flags.

To exemplify, let's create a simple Python script called `flag.py`:

```python

import sys

if '--flag' in sys.argv:
    print('Flag is set')
else:
    print('Flag is not set')

```

To run the `flag.py` script, you would run the following command:

```bash

python flag.py -f

```

The output of the `flag.py` script would be:

```bash

Flag is set

```

## Run Python Scripts from Command Line with Environment Variables

You can also pass environment variables to Python scripts from the command line. To do this, you need to use the `-e` or `--env` flags.

To exemplify, let's create a simple Python script called `env.py`:

```python

import os

print(os.environ['MY_ENV_VAR'])

```

To run the `env.py` script, you would run the following command:

```bash

MY_ENV_VAR=hello python env.py -e MY_ENV_VAR

```

The output of the `env.py` script would be:

```bash

hello

```

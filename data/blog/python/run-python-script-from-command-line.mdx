## Run Python Scripts from Command Line

This article will show you how to run Python scripts from the command line. This is useful if you want to run a Python script from a cron job or from a shell script. You can also use this to run Python scripts from a Makefile.

To run a Python script from the command line, you need to use the `python` command. The `python` command takes the name of the Python script as an argument. For example, to run the `hello.py` script, you would run the following command:

```bash

python hello.py

```

The `python` command will run the Python script and print the output to the terminal. If the Python script does not have a `print` statement, then nothing will be printed to the terminal.

If you want to run a Python script from the command line and redirect the output to a file, you can use the `>` operator. For example, to run the `hello.py` script and redirect the output to a file called `output.txt`, you would run the following command:

```bash

python hello.py > output.txt

```

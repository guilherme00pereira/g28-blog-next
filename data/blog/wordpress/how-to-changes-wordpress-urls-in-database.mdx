Changing WordPress URLs in the database can be a daunting task for those who are not familiar with the inner workings of WordPress. However, it is necessary if you are facing the following situations:

- moving your website from one domain to another;
- copying it to a local environment;
- changing your site's URL structure.

The process involves making changes to the site's database, and if done incorrectly, it can lead to errors and broken links.

To change WordPress URLs in the database, you need to follow a few simple steps. But first of all, you should create a backup of your site's database to ensure that you can restore your site if something goes wrong. Once you have a backup, you can use 3 different ways to achieve this task:

## 1) Using the Command Line

If you are familiar using command line, the [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/) command line interface is a handy way to replace the URLs in the database. It has the function [search-replace](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/search-replace/) which searches through all rows in a selection of tables and replaces appearances of the first string with the second string. Run this command at the root of the WordPress directory:

```bash
wp search-replace oldurl.com newurl.com --dry-run
```

The `--dry-run` parameter run the entire search/replace operation and show report, but donâ€™t save changes to the database.

Running again without the `--dry-run` parameter, it executes the entire search/replace operation.

## 2) With SQL Query

Next, you need to run SQL queries to update the URLs in your site's database. You will need to update the "siteurl" and "home" values in the "wp_options" table, as well as any references to your old URL in other tables such as "wp_posts" and "wp_postmeta":

```sql
UPDATE wp_options SET option_value = replace(option_value, 'oldurl.com', 'newurl.com')
WHERE option_name = 'home' OR option_name = 'siteurl';

UPDATE wp_posts SET guid = replace(guid, 'oldurl.com','newurl.com');

UPDATE wp_posts SET post_content = replace(post_content, 'oldurl.com', 'newurl.com');

UPDATE wp_postmeta SET meta_value = replace(meta_value,'oldurl.com','newurl.com');
```

  It is important to note that you should not change URLs directly in the database unless you are
  confident in what you are doing. Alternatively, you can use a plugin such as "Better Search
  Replace" to update your URLs automatically

In conclusion, changing WordPress URLs in the database requires a bit of technical knowledge, but it is essential if you want to keep your site running smoothly after a domain or URL change. By following the steps outlined above, you can ensure that your site's URLs are updated correctly and avoid any errors or broken links.

## What is a Cron Job?

A cron job is a task that runs automatically on your server at a specific time or interval. It is a great way to automate tasks that you would otherwise have to do manually. For example, you can use a cron job to automatically back up your WordPress site, send out email newsletters, or update your WordPress plugins. In this article, we will show you how to create a cron job in WordPress.

## Using WP-Cron

WordPress comes with a built-in cron job system called WP-Cron. WP-Cron is a great option if you only need to run a few tasks on your site. However, it is not very reliable and can cause performance issues on your site. If you need to run a lot of tasks on your site, we recommend using a third-party cron job plugin instead.

## Introduction

One improvement that we can do in WordPress is image quality, especially when it comes to performance, load times and user experience. WebP is a new image format that replaces JPEGs but uses up to 40% less data while retaining the same quality as JPEGs (and even better in some cases). The good news is that there are ways you can convert your existing images into WebP format. In this article, I will show you how to convert WordPress images to WebP format in 3 ways: via the command line using WP_CLI, when loading a post page, and via an endpoint call in the WordPress REST API.

## What Is WebP

WebP is a new image format developed by Google. It's similar to JPEG and PNG, but it provides better compression than either of them. This means that your images will load faster and use less bandwidth, which can be especially important for mobile users on limited data plans or with slow Internet connections.

WebP also supports transparency in both 8-bit and 32-bit modes (the latter being more common), allowing you to create true alpha transparency effects without having to rely on Photoshop or an external editor like GIMP.

## Setting up a Plugin

First of all, I will create a plugin to perform the conversion. I will use the WP_CLI library to create a command to perform the conversion. I will also create a REST API endpoint to perform the conversion. Finally, I will create a function to perform the conversion when loading a post page.

### The Plugin Hierachy

```bash

├── composer.json
├── g28-convert-image-to-webp.php
├── src
│   ├── CliCommand.php
│   ├── ImageConverter.php
│   ├── RestApi.php
│   ├── Controller.php
│   └── startup.php

```	


### The Image Converter Class

The ImageConverter class will contain the logic to convert an image to WebP format. It will use the Imagick library to perform the conversion. The Imagick library is a PHP extension that allows you to perform image manipulation operations. It is a wrapper around the ImageMagick library. The ImageMagick library is a free and open-source software suite for displaying, converting, and editing raster image and vector image files.

```php

<?php

namespace G28\ConvertImageToWebp;

class ImageConverter {

    public function convert($imagePath) {
        $imagick = new \Imagick($imagePath);
        $imagick->setImageFormat('webp');
        $imagick->writeImage($imagePath . '.webp');
    }

}

```
